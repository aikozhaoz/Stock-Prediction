# Stock Price Prediction Using Python & Machine Learning

* This program uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a corporation (NIO Inc.) using a 60-day duration stock price().

* The IDE I used for this project is Google's colaboratory. I just uploaded on github for a backup. :)
* Feel free to check my blog for further details about this project.
